# Prediction of Video Game Sales
Used Machine Learning regression models to predict global sales of video game titles based on historical data of user and critic ratings. Performed EDA on the dataset and used Principal Component Analysis to check for important features. Obtained best R-squared value of 0.65 from the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree model and found that the platform of the game, user count and critic score were the features contributing the most to the prediction.
